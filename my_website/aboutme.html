    <p>Hi, My name is Joseph Valasedes, and Im a junior at Lawndale High school. My hobbies consist of motorcross, video games, and hanging out with my family.
    I also like to play soccer and baseball. Im a purple belt in Brazilian JuJitsu. Im 15 years old. My favorite color is blue. My dream car is a jdm car, 
    that means that it is illegal in the USA. Anyways, the car is a R34 GTR Skyline. I also like street bikes and the street bike I like is the brand new Yamaha
    YZF R1. The video games I like to play are Black ops 3, Forza Forizon 3, and Modern Warfare Remastered. And if have an xbox and have a mic then add me.
